[Signals3 API documentation](https://makingthematrix.github.io/signals3)

This is a lightweight event streaming library for Scala. It's based on [Wire Signals](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-signals). 
Wire Signals was used extensively in the Wire Android client app - the biggest Scala project for Android, as far as I know - in everything from 
[fetching and decoding data from another device](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-android-sync-engine/blob/develop/zmessaging/src/main/scala/com/waz/service/push/PushService.scala) 
to [updating the list of messages displayed in a conversation](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/scala/com/waz/zclient/messages/MessagesController.scala).

### Main features

* Event streams
* Signals: event streams with internal values
* Abstractions for easy data transfer between execution contexts
* An implementation of (sometimes) closeable futures
* Methods to work with event streams and signals in a way similar to standard Scala collections
* Generators: streams that can generate events and signals that can compute their new updates in regular (or variable) intervals. 

### How to use

SBT:
```sbt
  libraryDependencies += "io.github.makingthematrix" %% "signals3" % "1.1.0"
```

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.makingthematrix</groupId>
    <artifactId>signals3_3</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
#### Syntax

In short, you can create a `SourceSignal` somewhere in the code:
```scala
val intSignal = Signal(1) // SourceSignal[Int] with the initial value 1
val strSignal = Signal[String]() // initially empty SourceSignal[String]
```

and subscribe it in another place:
```scala
intSignal.foreach { number => println("number: $number") }
strSignal.foreach { str => println("str: $str") }
```

Now every time you publish something to the signals, the functions you provided above will be executed, just as in case of a regular stream...
```scala
scala> intSignal ! 2
number: 2
```
... but if you happen to subscribe to a signal after an event was published, the subscriber will still have access to that event. On the moment of subscription the provided function will be executed with the last event in the signal if there is one. So at this point in the example subscribing to `intSignal` will result in the number being displayed:
```scala
> intSignal.foreach { number => println("number: $number") }
number: 2
```
but subscribing to `strSignal` will not display anything, because `strSignal` is still empty. Or, if you simply don't need that functionality, you can use a standard `Stream` instead.

You can also of course `map` and `flatMap` signals, `zip` them, `throttle`, `fold`, or make any future or a stream into one. With a bit of Scala magic you can even do for-comprehensions:
```scala
val fooSignal = for {
 number <- intSignal
 str    <- if (number % 3 == 0) Signal.const("Foo") else strSignal
} yield str
```

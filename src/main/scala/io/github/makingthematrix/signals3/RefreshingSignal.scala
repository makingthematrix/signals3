/** A signal which initializes its value by executing the `loader` closeable future and then updates the value the same way
  * every time a new refresh event is published in the associated stream. The type of the event is not important.
  *
  * A typical use case for a refreshing signal might be, for example, to inform another component that something changed
  * in the storage while already retrieving the updated data. In this case, the refresh stream can be anything that
  * indicates the data has changed, and the loader is the query. The refresh event might even be a false positive:
  * then the loader function will be called but the subscriber function of the refreshing signal will not be notified as
  * the result of the loader is the same and so the value of the signal doesn't change.
  *
  * @see [[AggregatingSignal]]
  * @see [[CloseableFuture]]
  * @param loader A closeable future computing the value of the signal. It's passed by name, so if it is created in
  *               the place of argument, it will be executed for the first time only when the first subscriber function
  *               is registered in the signal, or immediately if `disableAutowiring` is used.
  *               If the execution fails or is cancelled, the value of the signal won't be updated.
  * @param refreshStream a stream publishing events which will trigger new executions of the `loader`. If a new
  *                      event comes before the previous call to `loader` finishes, the previous call will be cancelled.
  * @param ec The execution context in which the `loader` is executed.
  * @tparam V The value type of the signal and the result of the `loader` closeable future.

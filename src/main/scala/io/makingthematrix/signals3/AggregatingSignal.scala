/** A signal which initializes its value by executing the `loader` future and then updates the value by composition of
  * the previous value and an event published in the associated `source` stream.
  * You may think of it as a more performance-efficient version of `RefreshingSignal`, useful when the `loader`
  * requires heavy computations but an update between one value and another is simple in comparison. For example:
  * ```
  * val loader: Future[ Vector[DBEntry] ] = fetchDBTableData()
  * val sourceStream: EventStream[DBEntry] = newDBTableEntryStream()
  * val updater: (Vector[DBEntry], DBEntry) => Vector[DBEntry] = { (table, newEntry) => table :+ newEntry }
  * val signal = new AggregatingSignal(loader, sourceStream, updater)
  * ```
  * Here, the `loader` fetches the whole DB table, but if we know that the only change to that table is that new entries
  * can be added to it, we can avoid calling the `loader` every time the event comes. Instead, we can create the `updater`
  * function which will combine the current value of the signal (i.e. the in-memory cache of the DB table, created by
  * calling the `loader` only once, when the signal was initialized), with the new entry.
  *
  * @see [[RefreshingSignal]]
  *
  * @param loader A future used for computing the initial value of the signal. It's passed by name, so if it is created in
  *               the place of argument, it will be executed for the first time only when the first subscriber function
  *               is registered in the signal, or immediately if `disableAutowiring` is used.

/** A signal which initializes its value by executing the `loader` cancellable future and then updates the value the same way
  * every time a new refresh event is published in the associated event stream. The type of the event is not important.
  *
  * A typical use case for a refreshing signal might be, for example, to inform another component that something changed
  * in the storage while already retrieving the updated data. In this case, the refresh event stream can be anything that
  * indicates the data has changed, and the loader is the query. The refresh event might even be a false positive:
  * then the loader function will be called but the subscriber function of the refreshing signal will not be notified as
  * the result of the loader is the same and so the value of the signal doesn't change.
